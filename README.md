Traditional sericulture, a millennia-old practice of silk production, grapples with significant challenges. Disease outbreaks, pest infestations, and suboptimal environmental control threaten silkworm health, reduce silk yield, and jeopardize the livelihoods of artisans. The proposed groundbreaking innovation that seamlessly integrates cutting-edge technology with traditional sericulture practices. The system harnesses the power of webcams, NodeMCU microcontrollers, sensor modules, and advanced machine learning algorithms to create a comprehensive solution for silkworm health monitoring and protection. Webcams, coupled with the YOLOv8 object detection model, enable real-time identification of foreign objects and silkworms, while NodeMCU facilitates sensor data transmission and bidirectional communication, ensuring a seamless flow of information. Sensor modules, including DHT-11 for temperature and humidity, MQ 135 for air quality, and an ESP-32 camera, provide comprehensive environmental monitoring. The React - Native framework builds an intuitive user interface, empowering users to visualize data and fine-tune model parameters, making the system accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. This integrated approach holds immense potential to revolutionize silkworm rearing, safeguard silkworm health, and enhance the overall productivity and sustainability of the sericulture industry.
